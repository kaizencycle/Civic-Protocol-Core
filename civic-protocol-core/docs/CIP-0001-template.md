## CIP Process

### Submission Process

1. **Draft**: Create initial proposal
2. **Discussion**: Community review and feedback
3. **Revision**: Incorporate feedback and refine
4. **Formal Review**: Technical and security review
5. **Voting**: Community governance vote
6. **Implementation**: Development and testing
7. **Deployment**: Release and adoption

### Review Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated on:
- Technical merit
- Security implications
- Backward compatibility
- Implementation feasibility
- Community benefit
- Resource requirements

### Voting Process

- **Proposal Period**: 7 days for community discussion
- **Voting Period**: 3 days for formal voting
- **Implementation Period**: As specified in proposal
- **Review Period**: 30 days post-implementation

### Approval Thresholds

- **Core Changes**: 67% approval, 20% participation
- **Interface Changes**: 50% approval, 15% participation
- **Informational**: 33% approval, 10% participation

## Template Usage

### Filling Out the Template

1. **Replace bracketed placeholders** with actual content
2. **Remove sections** that don't apply to your proposal
3. **Add sections** if needed for your specific proposal
4. **Use clear, concise language**
5. **Include code examples** where helpful
6. **Provide sufficient detail** for implementation

### Best Practices

- Start with a clear problem statement
- Provide concrete examples
- Consider all stakeholders
- Address security implications
- Plan for backward compatibility
- Include implementation timeline
- Seek community feedback early

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Vague or unclear specifications
- Missing security considerations
- Ignoring backward compatibility
- Unrealistic timelines
- Insufficient testing plans
- Lack of community input
